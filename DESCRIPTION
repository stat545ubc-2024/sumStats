Description: The goal of sumStats is to provide a simple function, sum_stats(), 
    which groups a dataset based on an input column and then performs summary statistics 
    on an input numeric variable within the dataset. 
    This function is useful for users that want to quickly obtain the mean, min, max, and standard deviation 
    of a numeric variable for separate groups within their data.
